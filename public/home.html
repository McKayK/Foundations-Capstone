      <p class="about">
        Hello my name is David. Moment Rings began as a hobby in my garage,
        making memorable gifts for my family. I soon developed a passion and
        desire to help others commemorate and celebrate those same memorable
        moments in their own lives.
        <br /><br />
        I’ve incorporated unusual and unique materials that represented
        something special to my clients, such as: wedding flowers, loved one’s
        ashes, sand from a special beach, dinosaur bones, antlers, or a favorite
        stone or metal. <br /><br />
        Moment Rings is all about capturing the important, but often fleeting
        moments in your life. Life passes too quickly. Let me help you preserve
        the memories in a quality custom ring to enjoy and pass on to future
        generations.
      </p>
